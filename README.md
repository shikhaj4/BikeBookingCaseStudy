# BikeBookingCaseStudy
## Overview
The aim of this case study is to build a multiple linear regression model for the prediction of demand for shared bikes. 

## Dataset
- **Source:** day.csv (Upgrade case study)
- **Size:** [730, 16]
- **Variables:**
  - Meanings are given in jupyter notebook

## Results
Key findings include:
- EDA (Uni, Bi and Multivariate analysis)
- p-value and coeff to see which features are playing key role using model summary
- Model building using sklearn and stat modals library
- Residual analysis
- Model evaluation using R-square and MSE (Mean squared error)
